# GitHub Setup Instructions

## GitHub Integration Status

✅ **Integration Complete**: Your local repository is now successfully connected to your GitHub repository at:
https://github.com/team-smartbros/movie-wiki

## Current Setup

1. **Remote Origin**: Configured to point to your GitHub repository
2. **Default Branch**: Set to `main`
3. **Tracking**: Local `main` branch is tracking `origin/main`
4. **Authentication**: Successfully authenticated with GitHub

## Future Workflow

For all future commits, simply use:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push
```

## Recent Activity

- ✅ Connected local repository to GitHub remote
- ✅ Resolved initial sync conflicts
- ✅ Pushed updated legal pages
- ✅ Verified integration with test commit

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues in the future:

### Authentication Issues
If Git prompts for authentication:
1. Use your GitHub username and personal access token (not password)
2. Or configure SSH keys for password-less authentication

### Merge Conflicts
If you get "Updates were rejected":
```bash
git pull origin main
# Resolve any conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push
```

### Check Connection
To verify your remote is still properly configured:
```bash
git remote -v
git branch -vv
```

## GitHub CLI Alternative

If you prefer using GitHub CLI:
1. Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
2. Authenticate: `gh auth login`
3. Use `gh` commands for common operations

Your repository is now fully integrated with GitHub and ready for collaborative development!
