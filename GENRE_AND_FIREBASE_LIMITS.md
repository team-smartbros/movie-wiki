# ✅ Genre Filter + Firebase Rate Limiting - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Issues Fixed:

### 1. Genre Filter Display ✅
**Problem:** When selecting genre, movies split across 3 sections (Popular, Latest, Coming Soon)
**Solution:** Show ALL movies in single grid without sections

### 2. Firebase Free Tier Limits ✅
**Problem:** Risk of exceeding free tier limits (100 connections, 10GB/month, 1000 writes/sec)
**Solution:** Client-side rate limiting to prevent abuse

## 📺 Genre Filter Changes:

### Before:
```
[Action Genre Selected]
Popular:        5 action movies
Latest:         5 action movies  
Coming Soon:    5 action movies
Total:          15 movies
```

### After:
```
[Action Genre Selected]
All Movies:     25 action movies in single grid
(no sections, just one continuous grid)
```

---

## How It Works:

### Normal View (All selected):
- Shows 3 sections: Popular, Latest, Coming Soon
- Each section shows 5 items
- Total: 15 mixed movies/TV shows

### Genre View (Any specific genre):
- Hides section headers
- Changes first header to "All Movies"
- Shows up to 25 movies in single grid
- Fetches from `/by_genre/{genre}` API
- Displays all results at once

---

## Code Changes - script.js:

### Updated scrapeByGenre():
```javascript
async function scrapeByGenre(genre) {
    // Fetch from API
    const response = await fetch(`${SCRAPER_API_BASE}/by_genre/${genre}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.items && data.items.length > 0) {
        // Hide section headers
        hideSectionHeaders();
        
        // Get ALL items (up to 25)
        const allItems = data.items.slice(0, 25);
        
        // Fetch details
        const detailedMovies = await fetchDetailsSequentially(
            allItems.map(item => item.title.replace(/^\d+\.\s*/, ''))
        );
        
        // Display ALL in first container
        displayPopularContent(detailedMovies, 'popularContainer');
        
        // Clear other containers
        document.getElementById('latestContainer').innerHTML = '';
        document.getElementById('comingSoonContainer').innerHTML = '';
    }
}
```

### New Functions:
```javascript
// Hide sections for genre view
function hideSectionHeaders() {
    const sections = document.querySelectorAll('#welcomeSection > div > div');
    sections.forEach((section, index) => {
        if (index === 0) {
            // Change header to "All Movies"
            header.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-film mr-2"></i>All Movies';
        } else {
            // Hide other sections
            section.style.display = 'none';
        }
    });
}

// Restore sections for normal view
function showSectionHeaders() {
    const sections = document.querySelectorAll('#welcomeSection > div > div');
    sections.forEach((section, index) => {
        section.style.display = 'block';
        if (index === 0) {
            // Restore "Popular" header
            header.innerHTML = '<i class="fas fa-fire mr-2"></i>Popular';
        }
    });
}
```

## 🔒 Firebase Rate Limiting:

### Why Rate Limiting?

**Firebase Free Tier Limits:**
- 100 simultaneous connections
- 1 GB storage
- 10 GB/month downloads
- 1,000 writes/second (soft limit)

**Without limits:** Users could spam comments/suggestions and exceed quotas
**With limits:** Protection from abuse while allowing normal usage

---

## Rate Limits Implemented:

### Comments (details.html):
```javascript
const rateLimits = {
    comments: {
        maxPerHour: 10,       // Max 10 comments/hour per user
        maxPerDay: 30,        // Max 30 comments/day per user
        cooldown: 10000       // 10 seconds between comments
    },
    likes: {
        maxPerMinute: 20,     // Max 20 likes/minute
        cooldown: 500         // 0.5 seconds between likes
    }
};
```

### Forum Suggestions (forum.html):
```javascript
const rateLimits = {
    suggestions: {
        maxPerHour: 5,        // Max 5 suggestions/hour per user
        maxPerDay: 15,        // Max 15 suggestions/day per user
        cooldown: 30000       // 30 seconds between suggestions
    },
    upvotes: {
        maxPerMinute: 10,     // Max 10 upvotes/minute
        cooldown: 1000        // 1 second between upvotes
    }
};
```

---

## How Rate Limiting Works:

### Tracking User Activity:
```javascript
const userActivity = {
    lastCommentTime: 0,
    commentsThisHour: 0,
    commentsToday: 0,
    hourStart: Date.now(),
    dayStart: Date.now(),
    lastLikeTime: 0,
    likesThisMinute: 0,
    minuteStart: Date.now()
};
```

### Check Before Action:
```javascript
function canUserComment() {
    const now = Date.now();
    
    // Reset counters if time period elapsed
    if (now - userActivity.hourStart > 3600000) {
        userActivity.commentsThisHour = 0;
        userActivity.hourStart = now;
    }
    
    // Check cooldown
    if (now - userActivity.lastCommentTime < 10000) {
        return { 
            allowed: false, 
            reason: 'Please wait 10 seconds' 
        };
    }
    
    // Check hourly limit
    if (userActivity.commentsThisHour >= 10) {
        return { 
            allowed: false, 
            reason: 'Hourly limit reached' 
        };
    }
    
    return { allowed: true };
}
```

### Update After Action:
```javascript
// After successful comment post:
userActivity.lastCommentTime = Date.now();
userActivity.commentsThisHour++;
userActivity.commentsToday++;

// Show remaining quota
const remaining = 10 - userActivity.commentsThisHour;
if (remaining <= 3) {
    alert(`Comment posted! (${remaining} comments remaining this hour)`);
}
```

## User Experience:

### Comments Section:

**Normal Usage:**
```
User posts comment → ✅ Success!
(No limit message)
```

**Near Limit:**
```
User posts 8th comment → ✅ Comment posted! (2 comments remaining this hour)
User posts 9th comment → ✅ Comment posted! (1 comment remaining this hour)
```

**At Limit:**
```
User tries 11th comment → ⏱️ You've reached the hourly limit of 10 comments
```

**Cooldown:**
```
User posts comment → Wait 5 seconds → Try again
→ ⏱️ Please wait 5 seconds before commenting again
```

---

### Forum Suggestions:

**Normal Usage:**
```
User submits suggestion → ✅ Thank you! Your suggestion has been submitted!
                          (5 suggestions remaining this hour)
```

**At Limit:**
```
User tries 6th suggestion → ⏱️ You've reached the hourly limit of 5 suggestions
```

**Cooldown:**
```

→ ⏱️ Please wait 10 seconds before suggesting again
```

## Firebase Usage Estimation:

### With Rate Limits:

**Assumptions:**
- 100 active users/day
- Each user: 5 comments + 10 likes + 2 suggestions + 5 upvotes

**Daily Writes:**
```
Comments:     100 users × 5 = 500 writes
Likes:        100 users × 10 = 1,000 writes
Suggestions:  100 users × 2 = 200 writes
Upvotes:      100 users × 5 = 500 writes
Total:        2,200 writes/day
Average:      0.025 writes/second (well below 1,000/sec limit!)
```

**Storage:**
```
Each comment:     ~200 bytes
Each suggestion:  ~300 bytes

500 comments/day:     100 KB/day = 3 MB/month
200 suggestions/day:  60 KB/day = 1.8 MB/month
Total:                ~5 MB/month (well within 1 GB limit!)
```

**Downloads:**
```
Each page load:       ~50 KB (comments + suggestions)
100 users × 10 views: 50 MB/day = 1.5 GB/month
Well within 10 GB/month limit!
```
